Steve Jackson Games' online policy and Far Future Enterprises' Fair Use policy
are incompatible with open source licenses, because open source licenses allow
selling while the SJ Games Online Policy and FFE Fair Use Policy only allow
giving away for free.  So I have to use a custom license.  It's based on the
MIT license, but slightly modified to disallow selling the program:
